Type Facet Autokern TODO list
=============================

 * Add support of italic/oblique fonts.
 * Add support for components.
 * Find more sample texts that challenge the algorithm.
 * Test algorithm against more fonts.
 * Test spacing (spaces).
 * Kern more fonts & add more samples to the manual.
 * Add discussion of the "samples" and "disparities" logs to the manual.
 * Rework the "glyph class" code, especially around "glyphs to ignore" class.
 * Add boundary checking for arguments.
 * Audit the side bearings process.  
 * Add a "defensive side bearings" option (or minimum) for fonts that will be used 
 	in non-kerned contexts.
